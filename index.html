        <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I am a passionate and goal-oriented teacher. I love working with people - especially children! Sports and leadership positions have equipped me to be an excellent team player. I enjoy various <a href="./Public/Hobbies">hobbies</a> in my free time and love spending time with my family. I am very versatile and believe that, with these qualities in mind, I would be an asset to any school. I am a firm believer in the school of life and wish to continue my studies to broaden my world. I am currently doing a web design course and wish to start applying my new skills in a possible side hustle.</p>
